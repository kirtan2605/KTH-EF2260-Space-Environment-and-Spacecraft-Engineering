# Space Radiation Effects

The project investigates radiation-induced Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in MATS satellite CCD imagery through anomaly detection. SEU occurrences are analyzed and correlated with SPENVIS particle flux models to better understand the impact of space radiation on imaging sensors.
